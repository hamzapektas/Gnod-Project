# Music Recommender-Project

This is one of the Ironhack Data Analytics projects


In this project we built a music recommender. The idea is according to a song which you give us we give you back a recomandation. Firstly we're looking from top 100 hot list if the style of your song is in the top 100 list we give there if not then we are recommending randomly from same clustered style. 

You can run the code by typing 'python Gnod.py' in the command line. 

Disclaimer: The name may seem Gnod but it's just a music recommender. The name comes from Ironhack Bootcamp project.
